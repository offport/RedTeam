## Passive reconnaissance 
_Passive reconnaissance_ is an attempt to gather information about targeted computers and networks without actually communicating with them.

The goal of this phase is to gather information such as:
1. DNS Info
2. IPs (to scan)
3. Technologies used and versions (useful to find vulnerabilities)
4. Emails, email formats, phones numbers (useful for phishing and brute force)
5. Sensitive files available online
6. Vulnerabilities (maybe)

Each one must provide identifying and contact information which may include: name, address, email, phone number, and administrative and technical contacts. This information is often referred to as "WHOIS data."

WHOIS simply works by typing the domain name in the search bar.

WHOIS is also available as a command-line tool. (Available on Kali-Linux by default)

	`whois www.example.com`

### 7- Wayback Machine https://archive.org/web/
The wayback machine is an archive of the entire internet. Basically they go to every website and they crawl it while taking screenshots and logging the data to a database. These endpoints can then be queried to pull down every path the site has ever crawled.

The wayback machine has a boat load of information. Before you decide to crawl a website yourself check out the wayback machine. It might save you a lot of time and effort by using other peoples crawled data. Once you get the data start looking for interesting files and GET parameters that might be vulnerable.
